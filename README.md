Community Kit Share – Sprint 1

Community Kit Share (Community-Kit-Share-Webapp) is a community-run gear-sharing platform designed to support cooperative access to equipment kits for group activities, training sessions, and community events. The project aligns with the theme “Sharing, exchange, and building community” by prioritising shared resources, sustainability, and mutual benefit rather than financial gain.

=== MODULE DETAILS ===

Module: Software Engineering (Professional Practice)
Sprint: Sprint 1 – Workflow & Setup Review
Theme: Sharing, exchange, and building community
Document Date: 2 February 2026

=== PROJECT OVERVIEW ===

Community Kit Share is a full-stack web application developed as a group project for the Software Engineering module. The application aims to reduce unnecessary individual ownership of equipment by enabling community members to borrow and share pre-assembled equipment kits for specific environments or activities (e.g. Winter Kits, Tropical Kits, Desert Kits).

Instead of purchasing equipment independently, users can request access to kits that are collectively owned and managed. Each request is reviewed by a designated coordinator to ensure availability, suitability, and fair use across the community. This structured request-and-approval process helps maintain trust, accountability, and transparency.

The platform is designed to support:

Browsing equipment kits by category or tag
Viewing detailed kit information and availability
Requesting kits for specific dates or events
Coordinator approval or rejection of requests
Tracking current and past borrowing activity through user profiles

The application deliberately avoids financial transactions. Its focus is on co-operative sharing, accessibility, and responsible use of shared resources, directly supporting the module’s community-focused theme.

Development is carried out incrementally using a Scrum-based approach, with functionality introduced progressively across four sprints. Sprint 1 focuses exclusively on planning, workflow setup, documentation, and environment configuration, providing a strong foundation for later development.

Node.js
Express.js
MySQL

Infrastructure & Tooling

Docker & Docker Compose
Git & GitHub
GitHub Projects (Kanban board)

=== SPRINT 1 SCOPE & OBJECTIVES ===

Sprint 1 is dedicated to workflow validation and project setup only.
No application features are implemented during this sprint.

Key objectives include:

GitHub repository created and shared with all collaborators
Branch-based workflow established and enforced
Scaffolding files added to the repository
README documentation created and maintained
GitHub Project (Kanban board) created and populated
Product backlog drafted
Docker environment prepared and runnable by all team members
Personas identified
Ethical and professional considerations discussed
Meeting records documented

=== JAVASCRIPT SCOPE (SPRINT 1) ===

JavaScript in Sprint 1 is limited to application scaffolding only.

It demonstrates:
External JavaScript file usage
Safe execution using DOMContentLoaded
A structured application entry point
No interactive features (e.g. form handling, gear selection, backend communication) are implemented during this sprint.

=== DOCKER SCOPE (SPRINT 1) ===

Docker is used to ensure a consistent development environment across all team members.

Sprint 1 requirement:

Every group member must be able to run the project locally using Docker Compose
Further service integration and CI/CD workflows are planned for later sprints.

=== KANBAN BOARD ===

A GitHub Project board is used to manage Sprint 1 tasks using the following workflow:

To Do
In Progress
Completed

This supports transparency, task ownership, and effective collaboration.

=== ETHICAL & PROFESSIONAL CONSIDERATIONS ===

Key considerations identified during Sprint 1 include:

Minimal personal data collection
Secure handling of credentials
Fairness and transparency in request approvals
Accessibility and inclusive design
Clear code of conduct and accountability
Full details are included in the Sprint 1 submission PDF.

=== SPRINT 1 SUBMISSION ===

Sprint 1 is submitted as a single PDF document containing:

Group details
Refined project description
Code of conduct
Personas
Ethical issues
Meeting records
Kanban board link
GitHub repository link

Only one team member submits on behalf of the group.
