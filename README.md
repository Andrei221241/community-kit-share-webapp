# Community Kit Share – Sprint 1

=== MODULE DETAILS ===
Module: Software Engineering (Professional Practice)  
Sprint: Sprint 1 – Workflow & Setup Review  
Theme: Sharing, exchange, and building community  

Document Date: 2 February 2026

=== PROJECT OVERVIEW (SPRINT 1) ===
Community Kit Share is a group-based full-stack web application project focused on building a community-run platform where members can share and borrow equipment kits for group activities and events.

Sprint 1 is dedicated **only to project setup, workflow validation, and collaboration structure**.  
No full application functionality is implemented at this stage.

=== COLLABORATORS / TEAM MEMBERS ===
This repository is collaboratively developed by the following group members:

- **Andrei-Cristian Moaca**  
  Role: Frontend UI (HTML/CSS)  
  GitHub: Andrei221241  

- **Issa Amtot**  
  Role: Frontend JavaScript  
  GitHub: issaamtot14-design  

- **Raul Pereira**  
  Role: Backend  
  GitHub: Raul01Pereira  

- **Karim Elmenshawy**  
  Role: Backend  
  GitHub: Karim20221  

All collaborators follow a branch-based workflow.  
Direct pushes to `main` are avoided unless explicitly agreed.

=== TECHNOLOGY STACK (SPRINT 1) ===
Frontend:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

Backend (planned, not implemented in Sprint 1):
- Node.js
- MySQL

Infrastructure & Tooling:
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Git & GitHub
- GitHub Projects (Kanban board)

=== SPRINT 1 OBJECTIVES ===
Sprint 1 focuses on establishing a professional development workflow:

- GitHub repository created and shared with all collaborators  
- Branch-based workflow enforced  
- Scaffolding files added to the repository  
- README documentation created  
- GitHub Project (Kanban board) created and populated  
- Product backlog drafted  
- Docker environment prepared so all team members can run the project  
- Personas identified  
- Ethical and professional considerations discussed  
- Meeting records documented  

=== JAVASCRIPT SCOPE (SPRINT 1) ===
Frontend JavaScript in Sprint 1 is **scaffolding only**.

It demonstrates:
- External JavaScript file linking  
- Safe execution using `DOMContentLoaded`  
- A structured application entry point  

No interactive features (e.g. gear selection, form handling, backend communication) are implemented during this sprint.

=== DOCKER SCOPE (SPRINT 1) ===
Docker is used to ensure consistency across development environments.

Sprint 1 requirement:
- Each group member is able to run the project locally using Docker Compose  

Further container configuration and service integration are planned for later sprints.

=== KANBAN BOARD ===
A GitHub Project board is used to manage Sprint 1 tasks using the following workflow:

- To Do  
- In Progress  
- Completed  

This supports transparent collaboration and task ownership.

=== ETHICAL & PROFESSIONAL CONSIDERATIONS ===
Key considerations identified in Sprint 1 include:

- Minimal personal data collection  
- Secure handling of credentials  
- Fairness and transparency in community processes  
- Accessibility and inclusive design  
- Clear code of conduct and accountability  

Full details are included in the Sprint 1 submission PDF.

=== SPRINT 1 SUBMISSION ===
Sprint 1 is submitted as **a single PDF document** containing:

- Group details  
- Refined project description  
- Code of conduct  
- Personas  
- Ethical issues  
- Meeting records  
- Kanban board link  
- GitHub repository link  

Only one team member submits on behalf of the group.
